# iOS Rasa Client

This is an iOS client that connects to a Rasa chatbot using Socket.IO. It allows the user to send text messages to the bot and receive responses in real time. The app also includes speech recognition capabilities to enable the user to speak their message instead of typing it.

## Requirements

- Xcode 12 or later
- iOS 14 or later
- Swift 5 or later

## Features

- Connect to a Rasa chatbot using Socket.IO
